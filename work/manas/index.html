              Let's consider another case. Consider our studio space. The long table is often occupied by other departments, leaving little room for CDP students. While not all of us may need the table, each of us likely has strong opinions on how that space should be used.

            <p>
              In NYC, this conflict is seen on a larger scale. So I began by exploring Community Profiles and district needs statements. A recurring theme emerged: challenges around affordable housing and parks and open spaces are common across many neighborhoods.

            <p>
              One specific example is the Elizabeth Street Garden, where local users want to preserve the garden as a green space, while the city plans to replace it with affordable senior housing. This tension between preserving public spaces and meeting housing demands has led to protests and legal battles.
              Such conflicts show a disconnect between developers, city planners, and local communities. As cities rapidly grow, the voices of everyday residents often get drowned out.

              This project leverages AI-driven tools to facilitate community participation in urban design. 
              The computational methods include <strong>text-to-3D modeling, interactive mapping, and AI-powered 
              data analysis</strong>. These tools allow users to input aspirations, generate 3D visualizations of 
              their ideas, and see their impact on the city in real-time. By using generative AI for modeling 
              and machine learning to analyze trends in community inputs, the project creates an iterative 
              feedback loop. This workflow democratizes urban planning, enabling non-experts to contribute 
              effectively. The methods also address the scale and complexity of urban environments, offering 
              scalable and adaptable solutions for diverse urban contexts.

              By involving residents directly in the design process, it shifts the narrative from top-down planning to a collaborative 
              framework. The speculative approach enables communities to imagine alternate futures, while the participatory aspect 
              ensures their voices shape these visions. Experimental workflows with AI and generative tools make it possible to visualize 
              and prototype ideas quickly. This methodology aligns with activist practices, critiquing the exclusion of local voices in 
              traditional planning and proposing a model where everyone is empowered to co-create urban spaces responsive to their needs.

              The project relies on community input text prompts/inputs describing what they want to visualise as well as the final design or image
              that they submit. Early analyses of user-provided aspirations and site-specific features demonstrate how data informs design decisions. 
              For testing the workflow, XYZ site in the Columbia campus was selected, the users were students from GSAPP, and a prototype dataset of the visuals and the prompts,
              was created and mapped, showing how AI-driven insights can support collaborative planning.

              The project uses open source generative AI Image generation models from Huggingface, LLMs (Large Language Models) specifically GPT by OpenAI.

              In the future we can also integrate AI 3D generation instead of relying on just images. That way the user can also see the visualization from different angles to get a better 
              understanding. We can also integrate VR into this tool, as well as real time rendering AI models, so that users can also experience their designs spatially and virtually.

              The project People-Powered Gen AI: Collaborating with Generative AI for Civic Engagement by Sarah Williams explores how AI can be leveraged to analyze 
              qualitative data for civic purposes, while the Bloomberg article AI-Powered Urban Innovations Bring Promise, Risk to Future Cities 
              highlights the potential and challenges of integrating AI in urban innovations. Similarly, the review by Simon Elias Bibri and colleagues 
              discusses the interplay of AI and digital twins in planning sustainable smart cities, and Yen-Chia Hsu et al.’s work emphasizes empowering 
              local communities through AI. Together, these works inspire my project by showcasing how AI can be used to analyze complex datasets, 
              engage communities, and enhance sustainability efforts in urban environments.
